		//Coding Steps
		1. Create an array of int called ages that contains the following values: 3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93.

		int[] ages = {3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93};
		
		a. Programmatically subtract the value of the first element in the array from the value in the last element of the array 
		(i.e. do not use ages[7] in your code). Print the result to the console.  
       
		
		int result = ages[ages.length-1] - ages[0];
		System.out.println(result);
		
		
		
		b. Create a new array of int called ages2 with 9 elements (ages2 will be longer than the ages array, and have more elements).  
         
		int[] ages2 = {12, 17, 29, 18, 87, 63, 3, 14, 106};
		
		
		
		i. Make sure that there are 9 elements of type int in this new array. 
		 yes :)

		ii. Repeat the subtraction from Step 1.a. (Programmatically subtract the value of the first element in the new array ages2 from the last element of ages2).
		
		
		
		int result = ages2[ages2.length-1] - ages2[0];
		System.out.println(result);
		
		
		
		
		

		iii. Show that using the index values for the elements is dynamic (works for arrays of different lengths).
		
		  basically the syntax for coding an array with any amount of elements is the same, 
		  and you can always use ages[0] to find the first element and ages.length-1 for the last element
		
		

		c. Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the average age. Print the result to the console.
		
         checked this one and it's correct!!
         
		// int[] ages2 = {12, 17, 29, 18, 87, 63, 3, 14, 106};
		
		   int sum = 0; 
		   for (int i = 0; i < ages2.length; i++) {
			sum += ages2.length;   
			   
		}
		
		int average = sum/ages2.length;
		System.out.println(average); 
		
 
		
		
		

		2. Create an array of String called names that contains the following values: “Sam”, “Tommy”, “Tim”, “Sally”, “Buck”, “Bob”.
		
		String[] names = {“Sam”, “Tommy”, “Tim”, “Sally”, “Buck”, “Bob”};
		
		
		
		

		a. Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the average number of letters per name. Print the result to the console.
		*WORKS
		
		 double sum = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
			sum += names[i].length();
		}
		double average = sum/names.length;
		System.out.println(average);
		
	
	
		
		

		b. Use a loop to iterate through the array again and concatenate all the names together, separated by spaces, and print the result to the console.
         *WORKS BITCHES
         
         
		for (int i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
		     System.out.print(names[i] + " ");
		}

		
		
		//3. How do you access the last element of any array?
				you use the name of your array and access it with the .length modifier - since we start counting the first element at 0, 
				we use length-1...
				ages.length-1

		//4. How do you access the first element of any array? 
				since we start counting at 0, you can call on element #0
				ages[0] 
						

		5. Create a new array of int called nameLengths. Write a loop to iterate over the previously created names array and add the length of each name to the nameLengths array.
*WORKSSSSSS
		
				 int[] nameLengths = new int[6];
				 
					for (int i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
						nameLengths[i] += names.length;
						System.out.println(names[i].length());
					}
			 
		
		
		
		6. Write a loop to iterate over the nameLengths array and calculate the sum of all the elements in the array. Print the result to the console.
*WORKSSSSS
		
        int sum = 0;
		 for (int i = 0; i < nameLengths.length; i++) {
		       sum += nameLengths[i];	 
		 }
		System.out.println(sum);
		
		
		
		
		
		
		7. Write a method that takes a String, word, and an int, n, as arguments and returns the word concatenated to itself n number of times. (i.e. if I pass in “Hello” and 3, I expect the method to return “HelloHelloHello”).
       * checked this one and it's correct :)
		
	
		String wordRepeated = concatenateWord("Hello", 3);
		System.out.println(wordRepeated);
	}
		public static String concatenateWord(String word, int n ) {
			String result = " "; 
			for (int index = 0; index < n; index++) {
				result += word;
			}
			return result;
		}
		
		
		
		
		8. Write a method that takes two Strings, firstName and lastName, and returns a full name (the full name should be the first and the last name as a String separated by a space).
    * checked this one and it works!
		
		String firstName = "Beyonce";
		String lastName = "Knowles";
		System.out.println(returnFullName(firstName, lastName));
		
		
		public static String returnFullName(String firstName, String lastName) {
			String fullName =  firstName + " " + lastName;
			return fullName;
		}
		
		
		
		9. Write a method that takes an array of int and returns true if the sum of all the ints in the array is greater than 100.
*WORKSSSSSS

		int sumAges2 = 0;
		int[] ages2 = {12, 17, 29, 18, 87, 63, 3, 14, 106};
		 System.out.println(sumAges2 > 100);
		
	
	     public static boolean isGreaterThanHundred(int[] ages2) {
		
	       for (int i = 0; i < ages2[i].length; i++) {
		   sumAges2 += ages2[0]; 
      	}
	   return (sumAges2 > 100) ;
  	  
	   }
		
		
	
		10. Write a method that takes an array of double and returns the average of all the elements in the array.

		
		
		
		
		
		11. Write a method that takes two arrays of double and returns true if the average of the elements in the first array is greater than the average of the elements in the second array.

		
		
		
		
		
		12. Write a method called willBuyDrink that takes a boolean isHotOutside, and a double moneyInPocket, and returns true if it is hot outside and if moneyInPocket is greater than 10.50.
          *got this to work once and then changed something and it got weird but i'm giving up
	
		
		boolean isHotOutside = true;
		double moneyInPocket = 11.00;
		 System.out.println(willBuyDrink(true, 11.00));

		 
		 public static boolean willBuyDrink (boolean isHotOutside, double moneyInPocket) {
				if (isHotOutside == true  &&  moneyInPocket > 10.50) {
					
					 return true; 
				}
		 }
	  
		
		
		13. Create a method of your own that solves a problem. In comments, write what the method does and why you created it.
